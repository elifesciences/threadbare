# threadbare

A partial replacement for the slice of Fabric 1.x and Paramiko used in [Builder](https://github.com/elifesciences/builder)

See [TODO.md](./TODO.md) for what remains to be implemented for the first stable release.

Run the [test suite](./test.sh) with `./test.sh`

Run [example.py](./example.py) with `./test-examples.sh` to run a list of harmless tests against a remote machine.

Individual tests can be run with `./test-examples.sh -k test_function_name`
