# threadbare

A partial replacement for the slice of Fabric 1.x and Paramiko used in [Builder](https://github.com/elifesciences/builder)

See [TODO.md](./TODO.md) for what remains to be implemented for the first stable release.

Run [example.py](./example.py) with `python -m example` to run a bunch of harmless tests against a remote machine.

Run the [tests](./test.sh) with `./test.sh`
